Spirit Engine is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Spirit Engine is officially untested on other development environments whilst I focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/DaRubyMiner360/Spirit-Engine-Development`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

## The Plan
The plan for Spirit Engine is two-fold: to create a powerful 3D engine.

### Main features to come:
- Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
- High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded later, 2D to come first)
- Support for Mac, Linux, Android and iOS
    - Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
- Fully featured viewer and editor applications
- Fully scripted interaction and behavior
- Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine
- Procedural terrain and world generation
- Artificial Intelligence
- Audio system
